# X‑Marks‑the‑Spot

**Language:** Java  
**Framework / Tools:** JavaFX

## Overview  
X‑Marks‑the‑Spot is a two-player game (similar to Tic‑Tac‑Toe) where players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on a grid. The objective is to align three (or more, depending on your game rules) of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is designed to demonstrate game logic, turn-based play, and board state management.

## Features  
- Grid-based word search game  
- Words can be hidden horizontally, vertically, and diagonally  
- Highlights found words (if GUI-based) or tracks them in console  
- Supports multiple words per puzzle  
- Simple and clean user interface for easy gameplay

Game Rules
-Players are presented with a grid of letters containing hidden words
-Words can be placed in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
-The player must find and select the correct letters to form the hidden words
-Once all words are found, the game is completed

Skills & Concepts Demonstrated:
-Object-Oriented Programming: classes for Board, Word, Player, etc.
-2D array or grid management for the word search board
-String manipulation and search algorithms to detect words
-GUI or console input/output handling
-Scoring and tracking found words

Possible Future Enhancements:
-Add timer or scoring system to increase challenge
-Multiple difficulty levels with larger grids and more words
-Highlight found words visually in GUI
-Save/load puzzles
-Multiplayer mode or competitive word search
